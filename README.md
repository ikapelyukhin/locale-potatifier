# What is this?

This is a small script to perform [pseudolocalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudolocalization) on `.pot` files generated by `gettext`.

Inspired by [this](https://superuser.com/questions/1340277/pseudo-english-looking-characters-used-in-windows-10-insider-preview) StackOverflow question.

# Usage

1. Extract translatable strings into `.pot` file (with something like `xgettext` or `rake pot` task provided by [yast-rake](https://github.com/yast/yast-rake))
2. Run the script: `./potatifier.rb rmt.pot > ru.po`
3. Compile the `.mo` file: `msgfmt ru.po`
4. Place the resulting file where the application expects it (`/usr/share/YaST2/locale/ru/LC_MESSAGES/rmt.mo` for Yast)

Some of the strings weren't localized -- which is what we wanted to find out in the first place. :grimacing::+1:

# Bugs/TODO

1. The script transliterates everything, including named formatting placeholders and HTML tags.
2. It would be good to have another (non-cyrillic) set of characters to chose from.
